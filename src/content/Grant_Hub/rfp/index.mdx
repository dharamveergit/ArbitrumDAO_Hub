### Objectives

**1. Experimenting with Funding Mechanisms**

- For continuing experimentation with novel funding mechanisms to better allocate funds based on the ecosystem function being funded.
- Understanding the intricacies of various funding mechanisms is crucial to the success of any grant program. Our RFP process is designed to not only match programs with known funding models but also to explore and experiment with these mechanisms. This includes experimenting with different organizational structures, such as centralized and crowdsourced assessments, as well as comparing pre-planned evaluation processes with challenge bounties.
- This exploration will help us grasp which models best support different types of initiatives, ensuring that our future funding strategies are as effective and impactful as possible.

**2. Seeking a Diversity of Perspectives**

- For matching strong community leaders around the world to proven funding mechanisms, coaching, runbooks, and support network.
- One of our primary objectives is to identify and engage program managers from a wide range of perspectives. These may include unique contextual perspectives, technical capabilities, and geographical regions. We believe that local insights and experiences are invaluable assets that can drive the success of grant programs. By matching these diverse talents with suitable funding mechanisms, we aim to cultivate a global network of innovators who can bring unique perspectives and solutions to the table.

**3. Addressing Immediate Needs of the Arbitrum DAO**

- For immediately providing support to the current biggest needs of Arbitrum DAO.
- The Arbitrum DAO faces its unique set of challenges and opportunities. Part of our RFP process is dedicated to identifying grant programs that can address these immediate needs. By solving these pressing issues, we aim to demonstrate the power of community-driven innovation and the potential for rapid, effective change within the Arbitrum ecosystem.
- Examples of the types of needs that might be addressed:
  - The onboarding working group needs funds to allocate to start a bounty board
  - A group of delegates want a previously not provided data analysis about an ongoing incentive program
  - A community member recognizes people contributing to the ecosystem that are not being fairly rewarded
  - An orbit adoption education materials creation contest idea needs to be matched with a program manager and funds to become a reality
  - Funding: Approximately 3 million ARB available for distribution between 5-10 programs. While addressing immediate DAO needs is valuable, it must be done within the broader context of this program and the DAOs overarching goals.

The RFP program, with approximately 3 million ARB available for distribution in Milestone 1(b) 3, aims to support five to ten selected programs. The primary goal for applicants is to design grant programs that illustrate a clear return on investment, aiming for a "one dollar in, two dollars out" value proposition. Proposals should focus on generating measurable results and scalability. While the program is unlikely to fund initiatives requesting over 500k ARB, this limit includes both administration and development costs. Applicants are encouraged to prioritize scalable outcomes that surpass the initial investment.
