## 🔖 Some Governance Discussions:

![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/19e946cb8758bb6f34f5e71eeac58c61bc8cded4.jpeg "8")

### [](#rfc-arbitrum-multi-sig-support-service-msshttpsforumarbitrumfoundationtrfc-arbitrum-multi-sig-support-service-mss23737-15)[\[RFC\] Arbitrum Multi-sig Support Service (MSS)](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-arbitrum-multi-sig-support-service-mss/23737)

This proposal outlines the creation of a “Multi-sig Support Service” (MSS) to reduce costs, improve efficiency, and enhance transparency.

Rationale

The current system of individual multi-sig signers across various Arbitrum DAO programs is financially unsustainable. The costs are projected to rise significantly with future program growth, placing a strain on the DAO’s resources. Additionally, the fragmented structure lacks consistency, transparency, and professionalism. This proposal seeks to address these issues by establishing a centralized and efficient “Multi-sig Support Service” (MSS).

Implementation

- **Elected MSS Committee:** The DAO will elect 12 individuals to form the MSS committee. These members will be responsible for managing multi-sig signing across all DAO-funded programs.
- **Tiered Signing Threshold:** A tiered signing threshold based on transaction value will be implemented. This ensures appropriate oversight for larger transactions while streamlining smaller ones.
- **Compensation & Payment Structure:** Signers will receive a fixed monthly fee in USD, paid in ARB at the spot price. This eliminates fluctuations in signer compensation due to the volatile nature of ARB.
- **Standardized Approval Flow:** Each program will utilize a standardized payment approval flow within the MSS framework, ensuring clarity and consistency in spending processes.
- **Den Integration:** Den, a multi-sig management tool, will be implemented for improved efficiency and security.
- **Conflict of Interest Policy:** A strict Conflict of Interest Policy will be enforced for MSS members to maintain the integrity and impartiality of the service.

Project Asks

- Approval of the MSS program through a Snapshot vote.
- Allocation of 400,000 ARB to fund the MSS for approximately one year, with a renewal proposal for continued operation.
- Community participation in the application and election process for MSS members.

The proposal also presents the option to implement monthly “Token Flow Reports” by r3gen finance. These reports would analyze DAO inflows and outflows, providing valuable insights into financial activity. The cost of this service is $6650 USDC per month, paid in ARB at the spot price.

**Ask:** 400,000 ARB

### [](#aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrumhttpsforumarbitrumfoundationtaip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum23232-16)[AIP: BOLD - permissionless validation for Arbitrum](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232)

BOLD aims to enable permissionless validation across Arbitrum chains and enhance security by mitigating delay attacks. This protocol ensures that any single honest party can successfully defend against false claims to an Arbitrum chain’s state, marking a crucial advancement towards establishing Arbitrum as a Stage 2 Ethereum rollup.

Rationale

The upgrade to BOLD is designed to significantly reduce execution costs and bolster the security of smart contracts. By ensuring interoperability within the same ecosystem, BOLD facilitates smoother transitions and integrations, setting a new standard in blockchain technology.

Implementation

- A thorough audit by Trail of Bits.
- Extensive testing on public testnets for a minimum duration of eight weeks.
- A broad public audit program.
- The release of mathematical safety proofs and detailed formal specifications. This upgrade will necessitate modifications to the onchain smart contracts and the introduction of a new challenger manager contract on Ethereum, facilitating the transition for validators on Arbitrum One and Nova to participate under the new protocol.

### [](#temperature-check-change-arbitrum-expansion-program-to-allow-deployments-of-new-orbit-chains-on-any-blockchainhttpsforumarbitrumfoundationttemperature-check-change-arbitrum-expansion-program-to-allow-deployments-of-new-orbit-chains-on-any-blockchain23280-17)[Temperature Check: Change Arbitrum Expansion Program to allow deployments of new Orbit chains on any blockchain](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/temperature-check-change-arbitrum-expansion-program-to-allow-deployments-of-new-orbit-chains-on-any-blockchain/23280)

The Arbitrum Expansion Program is proposed to be expanded to enable deployments of Orbit chains on blockchains beyond just those deriving security from Ethereum. This proposal seeks community feedback on allowing Orbit chains to launch on networks like Bitcoin, Binance Smart Chain, Cosmos, among others.

Rationale

**Revenue Potential**: Broadening the permissible deployment landscape could significantly enhance revenue streams for ArbitrumDAO due to a higher number of deployments.

**Industry Influence**: By allowing Orbit to deploy widely, Arbitrum could reinforce the dominance of EVM-compatible technologies, promoting further adoption across diverse blockchain environments.

**Ecosystem Advantages**: While restricting Orbit chains to Ethereum-related blockchains could centralize and strengthen the Ethereum ecosystem, diversification may prevent potential limitations exclusive to Ethereum and address evolving definitions and configurations in blockchain technology.

Implementation

**Operational Changes**: If approved, the Arbitrum Foundation will handle the collection of the 10% profit share from new chains, ensuring these contributions are funneled back to the ArbitrumDAO’s treasury and the Arbitrum Developer Guild.

**Multi-Signature Requirement**: Projects must verify that the Arbitrum Foundation has established a multisig on the chain of choice to collect and manage revenue shares effectively.

**Program Documentation Update**: The Arbitrum Expansion Program description will be updated to reflect the ability to deploy on any public blockchain network, with continuous support and alignment with the Arbitrum DAO’s governance and community values.

Project Asks

The community is asked to participate in the decision-making process through upcoming governance calls and a Snapshot vote to determine if the Expansion Program should be broadened to include any blockchain network or remain exclusive to Ethereum L1.

**Discussion and Voting**:

- **Governance Calls**: Scheduled for April 22, 2024, at 10:00 UTC and April 26, 2024, at 16:00 UTC.
- **Snapshot Voting**: To decide between allowing any blockchain network or restricting to only Ethereum L1. The outcome will guide the Arbitrum Foundation’s subsequent adjustments to the program.

### [](#aip-nova-fee-router-proposalhttpsforumarbitrumfoundationtaip-nova-fee-router-proposal23310-18)[AIP: Nova Fee Router Proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-nova-fee-router-proposal/23310)

This proposal seeks to streamline the handling of transaction fees on Nova by automating their transfer to the Arbitrum DAO Treasury on Arbitrum One. This system change will allow for faster, more efficient access to funds and simplify financial management within the DAO.

Rationale

Currently, transaction fees collected by the DAO on Nova are routed through a governance-controlled address, requiring constitutional proposals for fund transfers. The proposed system automates these transfers, reducing the need for frequent governance actions and lowering the quorum requirement for spending, which enhances operational efficiency and reduces potential delays.

Implementation

- Implementation of fee router contracts to automate the distribution of funds from Nova directly to the Arbitrum DAO Treasury.
- Following the initial upgrade, a subsequent proposal will be introduced to reallocate any remaining funds at the original timelock address to the new fee router system, ensuring complete transition to the automated process.

### [](#aip-support-rip-7212-for-account-abstraction-walletshttpsforumarbitrumfoundationtaip-support-rip-7212-for-account-abstraction-wallets23298-19)[AIP: Support RIP-7212 for Account Abstraction Wallets](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-support-rip-7212-for-account-abstraction-wallets/23298)

This proposal advocates the adoption of RIP-7212, which introduces a precompile for the secp256r1 curve, facilitating the use of account abstraction wallets that leverage passkeys and secure enclaves. The implementation of this precompile aims to significantly reduce operational costs and improve the user experience on Arbitrum One and Nova.

Rationale

Introducing the secp256r1 precompile aligns with the Arbitrum community’s values by enhancing accessibility, security, and inclusivity. It enables cheaper and more secure account abstraction wallets, supporting users who prefer not to manage private keys traditionally. This proposal also embodies Ethereum’s ethos by promoting broader adoption through enhanced user experience without compromising security.

Implementation

- Public discussions on the Ethereum Magicians Forum to refine the proposal.
- Testing on the Arbitrum Sepolia test network following a Snapshot vote approval.
- Deployment on Arbitrum One and Nova upon successful testing and subsequent on-chain governance approval.
- The implementation will coincide with the next ArbOS upgrade, including Stylus integration.
