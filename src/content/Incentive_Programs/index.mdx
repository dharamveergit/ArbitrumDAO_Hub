### What are Incentive Programs?

Incentive programs within the Arbitrum ecosystem are crucial mechanisms designed to attract new users and liquidity while incentivizing protocol adoption and activity. These programs typically involve the distribution of ARB tokens to protocols, which, in turn, use them to incentivize their users. The overarching goal is to stimulate growth, activity, and innovation within the Arbitrum network.

The recent experience with the Short-Term Incentive Program (STIP) revealed both successes and shortcomings, prompting the Arbitrum DAO to reassess and refine its incentive mechanisms. Recognizing the need for a more robust and sustainable approach, the DAO has embarked on a Pilot Program to test new features and structures before committing to a long-term framework.
