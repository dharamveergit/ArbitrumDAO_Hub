      question: "Who is eligible to apply for GCP grants?",
      answer: `Both established game studios and independent builders are eligible to apply. The program encourages innovative game developers with strong ideas, regardless of their size. Studios and independent builders must submit a proposal detailing their project, funding needs, and milestones.`,
    },
    {
      question: "How much funding does the GCP provide?",
      answer: `
       The GCP is backed by a funding pool of 100-200 million ARB tokens. Grants are allocated to both large game studios and independent developers. The program aims to strategically distribute these funds to projects that demonstrate potential for high-quality, sustainable games.`,
    },
    {
      question: "How does the GCP support independent game developers?",
      answer:
        "Independent game developers can apply for milestone-based grants between 50K ARB to 500K ARB. The program provides resources and mentorship to ensure that independent builders receive the support they need to bring their games to market.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "What is the difference between grants for big studios and independent developers?",
      answer:
        "Grants for big studios focus on high-budget, large-scale projects, bringing AAA-quality games to the Arbitrum ecosystem. Grants for independent developers provide medium, milestone-based funding to support innovative, medium-scale projects. Both types of grants aim to foster game development and ensure the delivery of high-quality games.",

      question: "What outcomes does the GCP aim to achieve?",
      answer: `<ul class="flex flex-col gap-1 font-os  list-disc pl-5">
            <li >Onboard 80-100 new studios or builders into the Arbitrum ecosystem.</li>
            <li >Ensure that 50% of studios progress at least one phase during the program.</li>
            <li >Support projects through key development stages, from pre-alpha to worldwide launch, ensuring the development of high-quality, sticky games.</li>
